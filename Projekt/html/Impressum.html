                <p>The first arc is known as the “Hunter Exam Arc”, and it involves Gon taking the test in order to become a hunter. He quickly makes three friends: Killua, a mysterious young boy who is also a dangerous assassin, a doctor in training named Leorio, and the ever-powerful Kurapika.</p>

                <p>Season Two was a lot shorter than Season One and yet it felt the same length. This is probably because these next twelve episodes acted as a continuous training montage. God, I really want someone to sum it all up in a montage. That would make this recap soooo much easier.</p>

                <p>The Heavens Arena Arc consist mainly of Killua and Gon learning there are more powerful people in the world besides them and here’s a quick way of getting on their level. On one hand I like fighting episodes so I can’t complain too much, but this Arc is also where Hunter x Hunter explains the mechanics of how fighting works in their world. Wait, there are mechanics?</p>
